interactive-neurons is an interactive GUI that allows you to design and train 
simple convolutional neural networks. Through the GUI, you can tweak the 
network architecture, including features such as layers, connections, 
and activation functions. You can also customize training parameters such as 
the data split ratio, learning rate, training time, and optimizers.
